𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄

"Sports Basics" is a sports blog company that entered into the market recently. 

They wanted to get more traffic to their website by releasing a special edition magazine on IPL 2024. 

This magazine aims to provide interesting insights and facts for fans, analysts and teams based on the last 3 years' data.

Using Power BI, I delved into the last 3 years' data to uncover key insights requested for both primary and secondary analysis.
