**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

•	Learned to build a new visual (Calendar visual) using a matrix table, which can be utilized for different analysis purposes.   
•	By referring to different cancellation policies followed by various hotels, I understood that most hotels charge zero fees only if the booking is canceled more than three months before the booking date. If the booking is canceled after that, the charges range from 60% to 90% of the booking cost.   
•	Learned how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. Page navigation and the clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection.
